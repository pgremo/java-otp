        <p>java-otp is a library for generating one-time passwords using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226">HOTP (RFC 4226)</a> or <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">TOTP (RFC 6238)</a> passwords in Java.</p>

        <h2>Usage</h2>

        <p>To demonstrate generating one-time passwords, we'll focus on the TOTP algorithm. To create a TOTP generator with a default password length, time step, and HMAC algorithm:</p>

        <pre>final TimeBasedOneTimePasswordGenerator totp = new TimeBasedOneTimePasswordGenerator();</pre>

        <p>To actually generate time-based one-time passwords, you'll need a secret key and a timestamp. Secure key management is beyond the scope of this document; for the purposes of an example, though, we'll generate a random key:</p>

        <pre>final Key secretKey;
{
    final KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(totp.getAlgorithm());
    keyGenerator.init(20);

    secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();
}</pre>

        <p>Armed with a secret key, we can deterministically generate one-time passwords for any timestamp:</p>

        <pre>final Date now = new Date();
final Date later = new Date(now.getTime() + TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(30));

System.out.format("Current password: %06d\n", totp.generateOneTimePassword(secretKey, now));
System.out.format("Future password:  %06d\n", totp.generateOneTimePassword(secretKey, later));</pre>
